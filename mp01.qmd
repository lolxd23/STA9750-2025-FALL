With notable releases including Squid Games Season 2, Wednesday Season 2, and the animated premiere of KPOP Demon Hunters, 2025 has been a huge year for Netflix. There is no slowing down of this momentum. Netflix's success is only expected to increase as the much awaited Stranger Things final season approaches.

Let's examine the popular programming from the previous few years in more detail

```{r}
if(!dir.exists(file.path("data", "mp01"))){
  dir.create(file.path("data", "mp01"), showWarnings=FALSE, recursive=TRUE)
}

GLOBAL_TOP_10_FILENAME <- file.path("data", "mp01", "global_top10_alltime.csv")

if(!file.exists(GLOBAL_TOP_10_FILENAME)){
  download.file("https://www.netflix.com/tudum/top10/data/all-weeks-global.tsv", 
                destfile=GLOBAL_TOP_10_FILENAME)
}

COUNTRY_TOP_10_FILENAME <- file.path("data", "mp01", "country_top10_alltime.csv")

if(!file.exists(COUNTRY_TOP_10_FILENAME)){
  download.file("https://www.netflix.com/tudum/top10/data/all-weeks-countries.tsv", 
                destfile=COUNTRY_TOP_10_FILENAME)}
```

# Task 2: Data Cleaning

Replacing all the ‘N/A’ values with NA in the season_title column

```{r}
library(dplyr)

GLOBAL_TOP_10 <- GLOBAL_TOP_10 |>
    mutate(season_title = if_else(season_title=="N/A", NA, season_title))
```

```{r}

```

# Task 3: Data Import 

```{r}
COUNTRY_TOP_10 <- read_tsv(COUNTRY_TOP_10_FILENAME, na = "N/A")

  df}

# using the function we made, adding commas to large numbers and dropping

# Netflix India Shatters Records: Hindi Content Dominates as Subscriber Engagement Surges

**MUMBAI, India** – Netflix today announced extraordinary performance in India, where Hindi-language films and series have achieved unprecedented staying power in the platform's Top 10 charts. Hindi films have proven particularly resilient, with romantic thriller Haseen Dillruba maintaining its Top 10 position for twenty-one consecutive weeks and action blockbuster Sooryavanshi captivating audiences for twenty weeks. Recent releases continue this momentum: Animal dominated for seventeen weeks, Lucky Baskhar held strong for seventeen weeks, and Kiran Rao's critically acclaimed Laapataa Ladies sustained fifteen weeks of viewership. Television series have proven equally compelling, with The Railway Men - The Untold Story of Bhopal 1984 remaining in India's Top 10 for thirty weeks and crime thriller Khakee: The Bihar Chapter holding viewers for twenty-nine weeks.

The platform's expansion reflects remarkable growth in content diversity and subscriber engagement. In the third quarter of 2021, eighty unique titles appeared in India's weekly Top 10 charts. By the fourth quarter of 2023, that number had surged to one hundred eight titles, representing thirty-five percent growth. This expansion demonstrates both Netflix's increased investment in Indian originals and the sophisticated, varied tastes of Indian subscribers who consume everything from regional blockbusters like RRR (Hindi) to international phenomenons like Money Heist, which achieved forty-eight weeks in India's Top 10, and Squid Game, which maintained forty-three weeks.

India represents one of our most dynamic and fastest-growing markets, said a Netflix spokesperson. The data tells an undeniable story: Indian audiences are embracing both homegrown storytelling and global content with unprecedented enthusiasm. Films like Haseen Dillruba and Sooryavanshi achieve massive popularity in India without charting in the United States, proving our ability to serve India's unique cultural tastes while also connecting Indian viewers with the world's best stories. As the world's most populous nation continues its digital transformation, we're committed to expanding our investment in authentic Indian content across Hindi and regional languages.

# **Korean Wave Sweeps Southeast Asia: Netflix K-Dramas Achieve Record 42-Week Runs as Regional Engagement Surges**

**SINGAPORE** – Netflix today celebrated the extraordinary performance of Korean-language content across Southeast Asian markets, where K-dramas have achieved unprecedented staying power throughout 2024. The fantasy romance Alchemy of Souls dominated regional Top 10 charts for forty-two consecutive weeks across all six major Southeast Asian markets—Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, the Philippines, Vietnam, and Indonesia. Other Korean hits demonstrated similar longevity: Crash Landing on You captivated audiences for thirty-five weeks across five countries, Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha held strong for thirty-one weeks, and legal drama Extraordinary Attorney Woo maintained twenty-four weeks of viewership. This sustained engagement far exceeds typical content lifecycles and reflects genuine cross-cultural connection with Korean storytelling.

The breadth of successful Korean content reveals sophisticated audience tastes spanning multiple genres. Action thriller Vincenzo entertained viewers for twenty-nine weeks, while animated series Solo Leveling achieved twenty-seven weeks and Taxi Driver held attention for twenty-three weeks. Japanese anime also found receptive audiences, with Jujutsu Kaisen and Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba each maintaining twenty-two and twenty-one weeks respectively. Romantic comedy Business Proposal rounded out the top performers with twenty-one weeks across six countries. This diversity demonstrates that Southeast Asian audiences embrace compelling narratives regardless of origin, creating a vibrant pan-Asian entertainment ecosystem.

Southeast Asian markets showed robust growth in overall content consumption, with unique titles appearing in weekly Top 10 charts expanding from eight hundred sixty-four in 2023 to nine hundred fourteen in 2024, representing nearly six percent year-over-year growth. This expansion reflects both Netflix's increased investment in Asian content and growing subscriber bases across the region's combined population of over six hundred seventy million people. The platform's ability to connect Korean creators with passionate Southeast Asian audiences validates its strategy of investing in diverse, quality content that transcends borders and language barriers.
