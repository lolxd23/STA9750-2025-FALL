With notable releases including Squid Games Season 2, Wednesday Season 2, and the animated premiere of KPOP Demon Hunters, 2025 has been a huge year for Netflix. There is no slowing down of this momentum. Netflix's success is only expected to increase as the much awaited Stranger Things final season approaches.

Let's examine the popular programming from the previous few years in more detail.

```{r}
if(!dir.exists(file.path("data", "mp01"))){
  dir.create(file.path("data", "mp01"), showWarnings=FALSE, recursive=TRUE)
}

GLOBAL_TOP_10_FILENAME <- file.path("data", "mp01", "global_top10_alltime.csv")

if(!file.exists(GLOBAL_TOP_10_FILENAME)){
  download.file("https://www.netflix.com/tudum/top10/data/all-weeks-global.tsv", 
                destfile=GLOBAL_TOP_10_FILENAME)
}

COUNTRY_TOP_10_FILENAME <- file.path("data", "mp01", "country_top10_alltime.csv")

if(!file.exists(COUNTRY_TOP_10_FILENAME)){
  download.file("https://www.netflix.com/tudum/top10/data/all-weeks-countries.tsv", 
                destfile=COUNTRY_TOP_10_FILENAME)}
```
